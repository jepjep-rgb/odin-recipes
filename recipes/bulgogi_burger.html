    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="description">This is an easy, no-fuss way to enjoy the taste of bulgogi without having to marinate for hours or heat the grill.</p>
    <p class="description">Served with steamed white rice and cabbage kimchee, it makes a tasty Korean-inspired meal, fast.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>1 tablespoon sesame seeds</li>
        <li>2 pounds lean ground beef</li>
        <li>2 green onions, minced</li>
        <li>3 cloves roasted garlic, mashed</li>
        <li>1/4 cup mirin (Japanese sweet wine)</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Asian (toasted) sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 and 1/2 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="steps">
        <li>Cook and stir sesame seeds in a small dry skillet over medium-low heat until they are fragrant and toasted, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer immediately into a small bowl and let cool.</li>
        <li>Mix ground beef, green onions, roasted garlic, mirin wine, soy sauce, sugar, sesame oil, black pepper, salt, and toasted sesame seeds together in a large bowl until thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>Divide the meat mixture into 8 portions and form each portion into a large beef patty about 1/2 inch thick.</li>
        <li>Pan-fry the burgers in a large skillet over medium-low heat until browned and the meat is no longer pink inside, about 8 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the center of the burgers should read at least 145 degrees F (65 degrees F).</li>
